Due to the late partner assignment, Rodney already completed his implementation of the trie node structure as well as the function used to create and return a trie struct
before I could contact him.
-What I contributed:
+ the addWordOccurrence function
+ the freeTrieMemory function
-What Rodney contributed:
+ the trie struct
+ the createNode function
+ the indexPage function
+ the printTrieContents
-The debugging was done by both of us as we share the workspace and one would give an idea and the other tests it 
-In conclusion, I estimate my contribution to be 40% and Rodney's is 60%. To clarify, if possible and his trie struct and createNode function also accounted, the ratio would 
be 70/30 instead. He's the best guy I've ever worked with
